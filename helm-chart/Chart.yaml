  ### Kubecost exporter helm chart for Kubernetes

  There are two different ways to transfer custom Helm configuration values to the kubecost-exporter:

  #### 1. Pass exact parameters via --set command-line flags:

  ```
  helm install kubecost-exporter helm-chart \
      --repo https://flexera-public.github.io/cbi-oi-kubecost-exporter/ \
      --namespace kubecost-exporter --create-namespace \
      --set flexera.refreshToken="Ek-aGVsbUBrdWJlY29zdC5jb20..." \
      --set flexera.orgId="1105" \
      --set flexera.billConnectId="cbi-oi-kubecost-test-1" \
      ...
  ```

  #### 2. Pass exact parameters via custom values.yaml file:

  2.1 Create a **values.yaml** file and add the necessary settings to it as below:

  ```yml
  flexera:
      refreshToken: "xx-xxxxxxxxx"
      orgId: "7777"
      billConnectId: "cbi-oi-kubecost-1"

  kubecost:
      host: "demo.kubecost.xyz"
      aggregation: "controller"
  ```

  2.2 Apply this file when installing kubecost-exporter:

  ```
  helm install kubecost-exporter helm-chart \
      --repo https://flexera-public.github.io/cbi-oi-kubecost-exporter/ \
      --namespace kubecost-exporter --create-namespace \
      --values values.yaml
  ```


# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
